# Do the school performance metrics correlate to the financial conditions of an area?

Using data from City of Chicago and ZIP Atlas, we examined how school performance metrics correlate to the financial conditions of a given area. The financial conditions of interest were: ***median household income***, ***poverty rate***, and ***unemployment rate***. We defined an area by its zip code and, looking only at High Schools, we examined the data of seven performance areas: 

* **Student Attainment**
* **Culture/Climate**
* **Mobility rate**
* **Chronic truancy**
* **11th grade SAT score**
* **Drop out rate**
* **Suspension rate**
