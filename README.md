# Do the financial conditions of an area impact school performance metrics?

Using data from City of Chicago and ZIP Atlas, we examined how the financial conditions of a given area impacts school performance metrics. The financial conditions of interest were: ***median household income***, ***poverty rate***, and ***unemployment rate***. We defined an area by its zip code and, looking only at High Schools, we examined the data of seven performance areas: 

* **student attainment**
* **culture/climate**
* **Mobility rate**
* **Chronic truancy**
* **11th grade SAT score**
* **Drop out rate**
* **Suspension rate**
